<li>All metadata should appears in the response system  as a json file!
<li>Create a select all element!
<li>All elements should have the possibility to be magnetic for the grid!
<li>Vertical / horizontal button shoud reorganize group selected elements (may be only choice)
<li>Add a likert scale function
<li>Buttons toolbar in Quill to add #code markups!
<li> Wording question : Item library -> item bank, item repository, item collection, itemTh√®que, account, space
<li>Report line : Create a line that could be included in a report :

        <tr>
        <th>Question type</th><th>Example</th><th>Options</th><th>Comments</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>

        </ul>
</ol>
